- 👩‍💻 I've been laid off. #techlayoffs The project I was on was a runaway train
  that really stressed me out and I had to roll off a month before the active
  phase ended. It turns out that put me right in the line of fire for the second
  major round of layoffs across consulting. This is an unsettling situation to
  be in, but I'd like to believe that it is ultimately for the best. Time to
  find a better fit!
- 👩‍💻 I'm working on the site more now! Whee! Astro is fun!
- 🐕 Billie is awesome. Days are shorter so now our evening beach walks are
  leaving us more and more in the dark. It's kinda fun, though, because she and
  all her pals wear colourful lights or glow collars, and create quite a light
  show as they run around and wrestle!
- 🐴 Liberty had a weird little health scare last month. She spiked a hospital
  grade fever one morning which was easily handled with Banamine (antipyretic
  NSAID), until she spiked it again the next morning. An emergency vet exam
  turned up absolutely nothing clinical but a lovely healthy horse, so we drew
  some blood and started a course of meds until the results returned. The
  bloodwork showed a systemic bacterial infection, but we still had no
  indication of what it was or where it had come from. Anyway, she responded
  well to the treatment, and although she was a little bit off her hay for a few
  days afterward, everything soon resolved. I still don't know what any of that
  was about, other than perhaps some kind of reverse birthday present? Thanks,
  girl; I won't soon forget it.
- 🎈 I had a milestone birthday.
- 📺 I just finished _The Flight Attendant_. Season 1 was very entertaining,
  but&mdash;as is often the case&mdash;the follow-up was not as good; too many
  forced characters and an unexpectedly heavy focus on alcoholism and recovery.
- 📖 I've been reading a mystery thriller by a Norwegian author that I picked up
  in a Little Free Library. I feel like I could be good, but the characters are
  too amorphous for me to tell them apart (the Norwegian names probably don't
  help), and there is a strangely high number of words spent on street names and
  travel routes within Bergen.
- 🎧 I'm stepping away from the ragey metal I'd been listening to recently and
  digging into Dr. Draw's more recent catalogue&mdash;great for work and focus.
