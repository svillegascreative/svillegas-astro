- I'm unemployed again, following a 16-month extended contract as an
  accessibility specialist. I've enjoyed some time off this summer to be with
  family, and now I'm looking for my next role. I'm hoping to more dev-centred
  role in design systems, where I can officially have a hand in design and code,
  while delivering accessibility along the way. Job hunting sucks, though.
- As a result of the above, of course, I'm working on the site again. I'm gonna
  launch it this time, I swear!
- Billie is still awesome. She is enjoying a return to cooler temperatures
  lately, which allows her to play harder and longer (though she would gladly
  keep swimming every day, forever, too). Today she wrestled so hard with her
  best friend&mdash;Riot, a Rhodesian ridgeback with maybe 30lbs on
  her&mdash;that she was covered in his slobber, and then she rolled in some
  dirt, which stuck to the slime and formed a filthy crust. She's the best.
- Liberty is also still awesome. And chonky. And furry, already, per her supreme
  sensitivity to day length (winter is coming!). We snuggle and play lots and
  don't take life too seriously. I'm so lucky to have her.
