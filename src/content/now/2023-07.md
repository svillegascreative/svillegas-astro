- 💻 I'm on a project again! I was on a project for a couple of months in the spring, but that was a super-quick "lift and shift", replatforming a client's user portal from Angular to React with Next.js. Happy to now be on a real, long-term project, where we're building something new. This one's meaningful and high impact for the client and the firm, so... lots of good work to be done.
- 🐎 I moved Liberty to a new barn in the spring. I needed to get her the turnout she deserved, and I definietly wanted a more chill vibe agian. She has taken to her new surroundings well and is loving her extended turnout with her mare friends. Still, the change impacted our training a bit more than I expected while she settled in, and so I've been riding very little in the last while. We've been spending more time grooming, cuddling, and doing groundwork, so there's not much wrong with that.
- 🐕 Billie is awesome. She continues to be a delight in every way. She figured out how to swim and she LOVES IT, so now we spend every afternoon down at the beach with her besties -- the "after school club", I've dubbed them -- swimming, fetching, wresling, digging, and living her best dog life. Our apartment is filled with sand, but our hearts are full.
- 📺 I just finished watching _Black Mirror_. I didn't know much about it to begin with, and it totally struck me as a modern-day _Twilight Zone_. I really enjoyed it. Every episode was very well done, told a complete and engaging story. Some were a bit more out there than others, but the underlying commentary was fascinating.
- 📖 I'm re-reading Malcolm Gladwell's _The Tipping Point_. It's been on my shelf and moved with me several times and I thought it was worth revisiting after 20? years. There are some neat stories in it, but I quickly regained the feeling I got after reading some other pop-sci/pop-culture books a few years back, which is that feeling of a carefully curated list of anecdotes to illustrate a foregone conclusion. Anyway, it's good to be reading again.
- 🏕️ We've got a little vacation getaway booked for early August -- camping on a small private island we found on AirBnB! Hoping to pick up a new paddleboard before then and spend the days chillin' in, on, and beside the water.
