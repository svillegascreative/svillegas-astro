  Accessibility doesn't always need to be a big conscious act. Sometimes just
  being a decent person and thinking beyond yourself helps get you there.

## Expectations of courtesy: a story

The other day, returning from my morning walk with my dog, I was approaching the
front of my apartment building at about the same time as my next door neighbour.
We're not on speaking or even basic greeting terms (for reasons that should be
come apparent later in this story), so I just slowed my last few steps and let
him go ahead into the small atrium ahead of me. Behind me, a service provider
was also approaching, looking to access the building to attend to a client.

My neighbour, first to the secure door inside the atrium, unlocked it and
quickly stepped inside. Given that the atrium is so small and that I was
standing directly behind him, I was able to reach the door as it closed behind
him, sparing me the minor inconvenience of unlocking it again myself. The worker
behind me scoffed in astonishment as he witnessed this.

"Really!?", he said, as I held the door for him and we both stepped in.

"Yup", I said.

"REALLY!?", he repeated, as I stepped up to the first floor.

"Yup", I replied again, and chuckled.

He stood still on the landing just inside the door, with an abolutely baffled
expression on his face. He simply could not believe that anyone lacked the basic
courtesy to hold the door for someone behind them. [This was not a matter of
security either. My neighbour knew very well who was behind him.]

"Wow."

## Accessibility as a basic courtesy

I had reason to be similarly baffled today, which is what brought the above
incident to mind.

My colleagues know I will always raise issues of accessibility (and those who
meet me on a project soon find out). I have come to learn that our SOWs
(Statement of Work) typically include a very vague statement about
accessibility, usually to the tune of "we're not responsible for any kind of
compliance, we'll just do our best for now and deal with accessibility properly
later." [Yes, it kills me inside every time.]

So, you can imagine how I felt when, discussing focus indicators on input fields
with members of our design team, I had someone tell me "I don't think we will
have keyboard users on this platform".

I was floored.

I had been arguing a case for a thicker focus indicator in back-and-forth
messages with various team members for over an hour, becoming more strident and
impatient, and this message stopped me in my tracks.

"I simply can't respond to this," I thought. "I will throw my compoter out the
window if I need to continue this conversation."

I gave myself a time out.
