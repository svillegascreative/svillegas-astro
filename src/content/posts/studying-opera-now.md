title: I think I'm studying opera now?

  In the spirit of learning new things, appearing intelligent, and connecting to
  old memories, I've chosen to dive into this 400-year-old art.

I often find myself sitting around in silence while I work, not necessarily out
of preference, but simply because it's easier than thinking about selecting and
playing music. Yup, sometimes my mind is apparently too full to even complete
this task. Often, when I do pop open Spotify to work, I'll opt for something
"not distracting", like instrumental "chill vibes" playlists, nature sounds, and
sometimes even white noise.

The other night I leapfrogged a fleeting thought about playing classical music
and landed instead on opera. Huh. Opera?

## Why opera?

I had a sudden and quick dialogue with myself to justify this choice.

Why _not_ opera? I'm not opposed to the sound of it. I appreciate art. It'd be
nice in the background while I flex some brain muscles (here I pictured an
aging, reclusive intellectual in an old study filled with books, sitting at a
heavy desk by a roaring fireplace, playing opera on an old phonograph, thinking
Big Thoughts and writing Smart Words).

I'm not unfamiliar with _some_ opera: we studied Gerges Bizet's
[_Carmen_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_VkfIthWHo&ab_channel=HALIDONMUSIC)
in my grade 10 (11?) extended French class. In fact, I really enjoyed gettng to
know the story that connected some of the more

[bits](https://youtu.be/YUBxaK9T5II?t=4) I'd heard in isolation in other
contexts, and even downloaded the score into my personal music collection.

As I sat on that thought, it occurred to me that I've already been exposed to SO
MUCH opera in the same way: in commercials, TV shows, movies, and even cartoons.
Who doesn't remember the
[Looney Tunes version of The Barber of Seville](https://youtu.be/ydLzvWaX0C8?t=34)?
Or the
[freedom felt in an entire prison](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TN7YwSVVUgg)
brought by the soaring voices of "two Italian ladies", courtesy of a clever and
rebellious convicted banker? Wouldn't it be nice to put all of these songs into
the context of their original stories?

Also, just as _Carmen_ did for my classmates in French class &mdash; less for
me, as I was already fluent &mdash; examining some operas could challenge me to
flirt with my limited knowledge of Italian and German.

And just like that, I decided to make opera an exploration project for the year.

## The study begins

I know little about music and even less about opera, so I'm going to play it
like a beginner and find some introductory guides and then...follow my nose, er,
ear. YouTube and Spotify will be my steadfast companions in this quest, I'm
sure. Stay tuned for updates!
