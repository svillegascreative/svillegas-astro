title: 75" 400g Masta stable blanket
price: $60
description: 75" heavy winter blanket (approx. 400g). Made by Masta, it was the "Easy-wash" model, which had zippers on either side to be taken apart and washed in a home washing machine. The zippers failed over time, so the blanket was professionally sewn together -- does not affect the functionality of washability of the blanket at all. Contoured topline provides an awesome fit so it doesn't shift! Heavy duty front buckles, cross-biased surcingles, and rings for let straps.
